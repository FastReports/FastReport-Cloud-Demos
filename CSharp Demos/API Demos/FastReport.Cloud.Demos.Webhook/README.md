# Demo Webhook Server
## Overview
This application is a webhook server designed to demonstrate file upload functionality through a webhook interface.

## Getting Started
1. Run the application in IIS Express to activate the server
2. Send requests to the server endpoint once it's running (You can see how to do this using FastReport Cloud [**here**](https://www.fast-report.com/public_download/docs/Cloud/online/en/user/en-US/programmer/guides/rest_api/rest_tasks/rest_webhook.html).)
